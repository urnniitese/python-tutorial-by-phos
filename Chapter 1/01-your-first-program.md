# Your first program

You can create a very simple program using the `print()` function that outputs text in your console.

```python
print("Hello world!")
```

> The `print()` function needs to be followed by parentheses, which enclose the output we want to generate.

You can use this function as many times as you want in your program.

```python
print("First line of text")
print("Second line of text")
```

# Comments

Most of the examples in my tutorial include comments. Comments start with the hash character (`#`) and extend to the end of the line.

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello!") # Comments can also be also be used after statement, functions etc.
# print("This function isn't interpreted by Python.")
```

> Comments are not interpreted by Python. Use them to clarify your code.
