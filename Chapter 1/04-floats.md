# Floats

Floats are used in Python to represent numbers that aren't integers (whole numbers).
Some examples of numbers that are represented as floats are 0.5 and -3.56238791.
They can be created directly by entering a number with a decimal point, or by using operations such as division on integers.

```python
print(3 / 4)
```

Dividing any two integers produces a float.
A float is also produced by running an operation on two floats, or on a float and an integer.

```python
print(8 / 2)
print(6 * 7.65)
print(4 + 1.0)
```
