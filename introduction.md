# Introduction

Welcome to my self-made tutorial.

I will try my best to teach you Python in a small period of time.

# Installation

Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the lastest version for Windows.

Choose an IDE (Integrated development environment). For beginners I'd suggest using PyCharm, you can download it here: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows. Choose the Community version.

I personally use Atom, you can download it here: https://atom.io/.
